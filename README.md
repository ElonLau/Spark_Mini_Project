# Spark Mini Project

With this mini project, you will exercise using Spark transformations to solve traditional
MapReduce data problems. It demonstrates Spark having a significant advantage against
Hadoop MapReduce framework, in both code simplicity and its in-memory processing
performance, which best suit for the chain of MapReduce use cases.
